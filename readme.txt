Create quick and easy live blogs that keep your readers up to date on any breaking situation.

== Description ==
Live blogs are the essential tool for keeping readers up to date in any breaking news situation or sporting event. Using the power of AJAX, JM Live Blog allows you to add a live blog to any post with a simple shortcode to keep your readers in the know.

== Installation ==
1. In the WordPress Dashboard, go to “Plugins” -> “Add New” and search for “JM Live Blog” and click install and activate, OR download the zip file of the plugin and go to “Plugins” -> “Add New” and click \"Upload Plugin\" and upload the zip file.
2. In the custom meta box below the visual editor, select the color scheme you would like and add the update title, time and content for each update. Clicking \'Add Update\' will add a new update section. You can only enter one update at a time.
3. To add the shortcode to the post, go to the top of the visual editor and click the button with the JM icon on the far right of the top row of buttons.
